## Concepting and Discovery

### What is your main idea and goals of the project each week?
- Our goal is to create some useful visual effect functions in Zoom for online classes.

### Who are you working with?
- Tian Yi Fu, Yuxaun Hou, Tien-Wei Ho, Junbae(JB) Choi

### What problem are you trying to solve and how will code help?
- Most schools use Zoom as an online class platform. But we think it would be better if Zoom has some useful visual effect functions for students to communicate with classmates and teachers to make the class more engaging and more comfortable. 

### Does your project contain a dataset? How is it structured and used in your app?
- We are gonna collect photos related to some gestures. And then we will get some codes for detecting gestures from Teachable Machine by Google. And then we will make our own code to offer visual effect functions using p5 on the screen.
